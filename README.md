# üìÑ Resume Classification Tool

This project is a **Resume Classification App** built with **Streamlit** that predicts the job category of a resume.  
It supports **both pasting resume text and uploading resume files (.txt)** for instant classification.

## üéØ Project Objective

The aim of this project is to automate the resume screening process by using a trained machine learning model to classify resumes into their appropriate categories.  
This saves time for HR professionals and improves accuracy in shortlisting candidates.

## ‚öô How It Works

1. Load trained ML model files:
    - `resume_classifier.pkl`
    - `vectorizer.pkl`
    - `label_encoder.pkl`

2. Streamlit UI allows users to:
    - Paste resume text
    - Upload a `.txt` resume file

3. The app cleans the resume text and predicts the category.
